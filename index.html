						<p>Superman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created
							by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, high school students living in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1933. They sold
							Superman to Detective Comics, the future DC Comics, in 1938. Superman debuted in Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June
							1938) and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, newspaper strips, television programs, films, and video
							games. With this success, Superman helped to create the superhero archetype and establish its primacy within the American
							comic book. The character is also referred to by such epithets as the Big Blue Boy Scout, the Man of Steel, the Man
							of Tomorrow, and the Last Son of Krypton.
						</p>

						<p>
							In January 1933, Cleveland high school student Jerry Siegel wrote a short story, illustrated by his friend and classmate
							Joe Shuster, titled "The Reign of the Superman", which Siegel self-published in his fanzine, Science Fiction. The
							titular character is a vagrant who gains vast psychic powers from an experimental drug and uses them maliciously for
							profit and amusement, only to lose them and become a vagrant again, ashamed that he will be remembered only as a villain.
							Siegel's fanzine did not sell well. Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, which they self-published in
							a book they called Popular Comics. The pair dreamed of becoming professional authors and believed that syndicated
							newspaper strips offered more lucrative and stable work than pulp magazines. The art quality standards were also lower,
							making them more accessible to the inexperienced Shuster.
